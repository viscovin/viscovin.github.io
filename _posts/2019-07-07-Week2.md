# Advanced Forensics
**Forensic Computing:** is the process of identifying, preserving, analyzing and presenting digital evidence in a manner that is legaly acceptable. <sup>1</sup>
In other words, the process of unearthing data of probative value from information systems. 
It can be broadly classified in 3 categories: 
- Live Forensics
- Network Based Forensics
- Post-mortem based Forensics

### Principles to Adhere to:
- Minimize data loss
- Record everything
- Analyze all data collected (evidence) 
- Report Findings

**Evidence:** Anything you can use to prove or disprove a fact.

In the context of computer forensics, evidence can be found at many different layers: 
- Network (firewalls, IOS, routers)
- Operating System
- Databases and applications
- Peripherials
- Removable media (CD/DVD, USB)
- Human testimony

### Evidence Handling
You must preserve the integrity of the evidence at all times. 
- Creating a cryptographic hash of the entire disk and each partition
- Creating bit-image copies and analyzing them
- Creating a cryptographic hash of the copy and comparing with the results obtained from the original. (They MUST match) 
- Locking the original disk in a limited access room or container

### Incident Response Process

**Locard's Exchange Principle:**
States that when any two objects come into contact, there is always transference of material from each object onto the other.

When handling evidence keep in mind: 
**Once Contaminated - Stays Contaminated = Comprimised Evidence** 

### Initial Response
**Pull the plug  or turn machine off?**
- Powering down the suspect system can destroy critical evidence (in Windows, you may be able to recover certain data 
- Attackers take advantage of the volatile storage media
- The level to which one can hide data relies on the level of access to the system and the technical competency of the attacker

**Order of Volatility:**
When collecting evidence you should proceed from the volatile to the less volatile (see RFC 3227) 
- System Memory
- Temporary File Systems (swapfile / paging file)
- Process Table & Network Connections
- Specific Process Information May Be Dumped
- Network Routing Information & ARP Cache
- Forensics Acquisition of Disks
- Remote Logging & Monitoring Data
- Physical configuration & network topology
- Backups
