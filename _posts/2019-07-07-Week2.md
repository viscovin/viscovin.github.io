# Advanced Forensics
**Forensic Computing:** is the process of identifying, preserving, analyzing and presenting digital evidence in a manner that is legaly acceptable. <sup>1</sup>
In other words, the process of unearthing data of probative value from information systems. 
It can be broadly classified in 3 categories: 
- Live Forensics
- Network Based Forensics
- Post-mortem based Forensics

### Principles to Adhere to:
- Minimize data loss
- Record everything
- Analyze all data collected (evidence) 
- Report Findings

**Evidence:** Anything you can use to prove or disprove a fact.

In the context of computer forensics, evidence can be found at many different layers: 
- Network (firewalls, IOS, routers)
- Operating System
- Databases and applications
- Peripherials
- Removable media (CD/DVD, USB)
- Human testimony

### Evidence Handling
You must preserve the integrity of the evidence at all times. 
- Creating a cryptographic hash of the entire disk and each partition
- Creating bit-image copies and analyzing them
- Creating a cryptographic hash of the copy and comparing with the results obtained from the original. (They MUST match) 
- Locking the original disk in a limited access room or container

### Incident Response Process

**Locard's Exchange Principle:**
States that when any two objects come into contact, there is always transference of material from each object onto the other.

When handling evidence keep in mind: 
**Once Contaminated - Stays Contaminated = Comprimised Evidence** 

### Initial Response
**Pull the plug  or turn machine off?**
- Powering down the suspect system can destroy critical evidence (in Windows, you may be able to recover certain data 
- Attackers take advantage of the volatile storage media
- The level to which one can hide data relies on the level of access to the system and the technical competency of the attacker

**Order of Volatility:**
When collecting evidence you should proceed from the volatile to the less volatile (see RFC 3227) 
- System Memory
- Temporary File Systems (swapfile / paging file)
- Process Table & Network Connections
- Specific Process Information May Be Dumped
- Network Routing Information & ARP Cache
- Forensics Acquisition of Disks
- Remote Logging & Monitoring Data
- Physical configuration & network topology
- Backups

### Physical Memory 
Physical memory (RAM) is the short-term memory of a computer, which has a rapid decay of information as soon as memory module is disconnected from power and clock sources. Although as recent studies have proven, not as rapid a decay as we may have initially believed.
A memory dump from RAM can be very benefiacial as it contains a wealth of information that exists only when applications are running. Most of this information cannot be obtained from a hard drive and by analyzing the content of RAM you can find artifacts ‘hidden’ by the attackers and information about processes that have exited.
Physical memory is divided into "pages" and allocated virtual memory is mapped onto physical memory page by page.  The same page can appear at different locations within the same address space or in different address spaces. Remember that memory does not get over written when it is marked as free.

**What can be obtained from Memory?**
- All running processes at the time of the memory snapshot
- All loaded modules and DLL’s (dynamic link libraries) including injected malware
- All running device drivers, including potential rootkits
- All open files for each process, including path to file on disk
- All open registry keys for each process
- All open network sockets for each process, including IP address and port information
- Decrypted versions of otherwise encrypted data
- Contents of windows
- Keystrokes
- Email attachments, file transfers, and other “secondary” data
- Cryptographic key material
- Hard‐drive encryption keys
- WEP and WPA wireless keys
- Usernames and passwords

### Analizing Memory Dumps
**Diffrent Methods**
- Look for printable strings
- Reconstruct internal data structures
- Search for static signatures of kernal data structures

**Volatility:** 
Advanced memory forensics framework, Python, write and create plugins, useful plugins for malware detection and its free.
Plugin examples: 
- Malfind: detects hidden and injected code
- Csrpslist: detects hidden processes with crss.exe handles & CsrRoot-Process links
- Orphan threads: detects hidden kernel threads
- PSList: shows processes based on linked lists
- PSScan: shows processes based on the headers found in the “memory pool” 

**Yara:**
Malware plugins for Volatility, easy to write custom extensions. 

## Lab: Using Imager
**Carried out the following steps**
- Installed ImagerLite on VM machine.
- Opened Imager software and learned how to Capture Memory (Memory Dump) 
- Used Add evidence to look at the physical drive and locate the Master File Table ($MFT) and export file if necessary
- Learned about image types: Raw, SMART, E01 (used for EnCase), AFF when creating an Image of the physical drive. 
- After all the set up we have the option to verify images after they are created which will calculate the check sum before staring and then again after on the target disk and compare them at the end to verify copy is the same. 
- Learned about the Obtain Protected Files feature to copy files such as hybernation file, Master File tabel etc. Files that are not accessible because they are in use. 

## Lab: Using Volatility 
- Copied over memdump_sample1.mem file from share into VM and made sure a copy of vilatility was in the same folder 
- Open command prompt and issued the following command: volatility-2.3.1.standalone.exe -f memdump_sample1.mem imageinfo

-  volatility-2.3.1.standalone.exe -f memdump_sample1.mem --profile=Win7SP0x86 psscan
