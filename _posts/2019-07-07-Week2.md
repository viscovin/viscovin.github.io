# Advanced Forensics
**Forensic Computing:** is the process of identifying, preserving, analyzing and presenting digital evidence in a manner that is legaly acceptable. 1
In other words, the process of unearthing data of probative value from information systems. 
It can be broadly classified in 3 categories: 
- Live Forensics
- Network Based Forensics
- Post-mortem based Forensics

### Principles to Adhere to
- Minimize data loss
- Record everything
- Analyze all data collected (evidence) 
- Report Findings

** Evidence:** Anything you can use to prove or disprove a fact.
In the context of computer forensics, evidence can be found at many different layers: 
- Network (firewalls, IOS, routers)
- Operating System
- Databases and applications
- Peripherials
- Removable media (CD/DVD, USB)
- Human testimony
