# Final: Hack the Box
### Instructions:
1.	Obtain an account on Hack the Box. This requires generating your own invitation code. [5 points]
2.	Complete a minimum of 3 challenges of your choice. These should sum to at least 50 points. Extra credit will be given for points over 75 in a 10:1 fashion -- every 10 points over 75 that you get, you get an extra point on your FINAL COURSE GRADE. [30 points -- 10/challenge completed]
3.	Write up how you did the above. This include how you completed the challenge, your thought process that got you there, and a description of any tools you used and how you used them. [60 points -- 20/challenge completed and 5 for how you obtained an invitation code]
When first going to https://www.hackthebox.eu/invite I was greeted with a very simple webpage and absolutely no clue as to what I was supposed to do. First thing I tried was click F12 to get to the Developer tools and see if I could find any clues in the JavaScript or html

After exploring a few of the tabs I opened the Sources tab and immediately got drawn to the inviteapi.min.js file

There are a few interesting words here but it is not really readable. I can infer there a couple of function calls but can’t really read their function quite yet. I looked for an online javascript deobfuscate tool also saw an online site that called it a java beautifier which I thought was very apt. 
Loos like I found my first clue. There seems to be function that generates an invite code.
