# Hack the Box
### Instructions:
1.	Obtain an account on Hack the Box. This requires generating your own invitation code. [5 points]
2.	Complete a minimum of 3 challenges of your choice. These should sum to at least 50 points. Extra credit will be given for points over 75 in a 10:1 fashion -- every 10 points over 75 that you get, you get an extra point on your FINAL COURSE GRADE. [30 points -- 10/challenge completed]
3.	Write up how you did the above. This include how you completed the challenge, your thought process that got you there, and a description of any tools you used and how you used them. [60 points -- 20/challenge completed and 5 for how you obtained an invitation code]
When first going to https://www.hackthebox.eu/invite I was greeted with a very simple webpage and absolutely no clue as to what I was supposed to do. First thing I tried was click F12 to get to the Developer tools and see if I could find any clues in the JavaScript or html

After exploring a few of the tabs I opened the Sources tab and immediately got drawn to the inviteapi.min.js file

There are a few interesting words here but it is not really readable. I can infer there a couple of function calls but can’t really read their function quite yet. I looked for an online javascript deobfuscate tool also saw an online site that called it a java beautifier which I thought was very apt. 
Loos like I found my first clue. There seems to be function that generates an invite code.

I went to the Console tab and typed makeInviteCode() which returns a long string with encryption type Base64. I get very excited thinking this it.

I googled for a Base64 decoder and went to https://www.base64decode.org/  and entered the string hoping this will return an invite code. This was not the case, but it did provide another hint.

In retrospect I should have been able to deduce this myself from the code on the makeInviteCode() if I had spent a little more time on it.  
Back to google to find a tool to make a POST request online https://reqbin.com

Back to https://www.base64decode.org/   to decode the string. This looks a lot more promising as it is not in the form of another clue and looks like a product key.

I go back to the invite page and enter the code and am finally able to Sign Up. I go through a brief registration process and an email is sent to me to verify my account.

My initial thoughts were that if the challenges were going to be as time consuming as and round about as getting the invite code I’d better start small.  I looked for easy challenges with not so many points, to start with. There were several 10 point option but I finally decided on trying the crypto challenges first. 

## Challenge 1: You Can Do It! (10 Points)

Download a .zip file that contains a text file.  After opening the text file I was pleasantly surprised to find out I could figure this challenge on my own without the use of any computer or software. The only clue I needed was the name of the challenge. I unscrambled the letters with pen and paper and came back with YOUCANDOIT!YOUSEETHAT the first try but unfortunately that was not the flag. I was pretty sure I had the correct words I just had to play with their order a little. After a few tries of changing word and punctuation orders I was rewarded with my first 10 points.  So this was challenge at least for me was more of a trial and error.
