### Terminology Fundamentals
- **Spam:** is the use of messaging systems to send an unsolicited message (spam), especially advertising, as well as sending messages repeatedly on the same site.
- **Spamtrap/Honeypot:** are a type of fraud management tool, used by major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and blacklist providers to identify spammers so they can block emails from them. 
- **Botnet:** is a number of Internet-connected devices, each of which is running one or more bots. Botnets can be used to perform distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), steal data, send spam, and allows the attacker to access the device and its connection. 
- **Snowshoe spam:** unsolicited bulk email. And it's been effective, because like a snowshoe, it spreads the load across a large area. In this case, distributing spam across a huge range of IP addresses many of which are used briefly, and only once, sending out massive volumes of spam in very short bursts.
- **Phishing:** the fraudulent practice of sending emails purporting to be from reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers. 
- **Spear Phishing:** the fraudulent practice of sending emails ostensibly from a known or trusted sender in order to induce targeted individuals to reveal confidential information. 
- **RBL:** Real-time blackhole list (RBL) is a dynamic list of IP address owners that are active spammers or spam sources. The RBL may include Internet service providers (ISP) with customers that are known spammers or ISP servers that are hijacked for spamming purposes. RBL is also known as a DNS Black List (DNSBL).
- **Heuristics:** 
- **Bayesian:** Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. Bayesian inference is an important technique in statistics, and especially in mathematical statistics.
- **Fingerprinting/Hashing:** Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key that represents the original string. Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a database because it is faster to find the item using the shorter hashed key than to find it using the original value.

## Technology 
### The Engines
- Reputation-driven
    - IP
    - Message
    - URL

- Content-driven
    - Common strings
    - Fixed strings vs variable strings (Regular Expression)
    - Message attributes
    - Combinations of strings and attributes (Meta Rules)

### Tools for Research 
- Linux Tools
    - DIG - Domain information groper – investigation of DNS records
    - WHOIS – Searching for IP/Domain registration information
    - Grep, SED, AWK – data parsing and manipulation 
- Open-source databases
    - PostgreSQL – “The world's most advanced open source database”
    - MySQL – “The world's most popular open source database”
- The Regex Coach
    - Regular Expression syntax/functionality learning aid
- Trustedsource.org
    - Historical & current reputations based on McAfee data
- Spamhaus.org
    - Widely accepted as an authoritative source of reputation data (Especially in NA)

**Considerations:**
- Human input required?
    - How much over time?
    - What quality assurances can be expected?
    - Value of human input vs automation?
- Fully automated?
    - Initial human resource cost?
    - Fault tolerance/resiliency?
- Combination of automation and human input?
- Probability scoring vs additive scoring
