- Social Engineering: user knowingly runs an executable (Copy cat apps) 
- Abusing features: USB Autorun, physcial access
- Browser based exploits: Scripts, pdf, java
- Redirects

**Establish Presence**

*Blend in or Hide*
* Appear Legitimate
    - OS like filenames or wrong path
    - Change Creation/Modification
    - Signed
* Hide 
    - Bootkit
    - Rootkit

*Persist*
- System startup (bootkit)
- Windows Startup (Services, AppINIT, Winlogon, Run keys, Startup folder) 
- Aplication startup (DLL hijacking, parasitic, shell extension handler
- Other such as scheduled tasks, autorun.inf

**Malicious Activity**

*Harvest Information*
- Enumerate (Docs, Passwords, Email, Processes)
- Hook (Browser, Keylog, Screen Scrap)

### YARA (Pattern matching swiss knife for malware researchers)
- Strings expressed as “mystring”, can be followed by
    * nocase – case insensitive
    * wide – strip zeroes in unicode strings
    * wide ascii – searches both wide and ascii strings
    * fullword – only considers full delimited strings, not substrings
- Byte patterns (aka Hexadecimal strings) as {4D 5A 90 00}
    * Accepts “?” and “??” wildcards { E2 34 ?? C8 A? FB }
    * “Jumps” to denote a number of wildcards { E2 34 [3-4] FB }
    * OR Fragements { E2 34 (23 C8 | 24 C8 25) FB }
- Conditions can include boolean operators (and, or, not), relational (>=, <=, <, >, ==, !=), arithmetic (+,-,*,\), and bitwise (&, |, <<, >>, ~)
    * ($a or $b)
    * #a == 6 and #b > 10
    * $a at 100 and $b at 200 (at virtual address)
