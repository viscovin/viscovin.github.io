### YARA (Pattern matching swiss knife for malware researchers)
- Strings expressed as “mystring”, can be followed by
    * nocase – case insensitive
    * wide – strip zeroes in unicode strings
    * wide ascii – searches both wide and ascii strings
    * fullword – only considers full delimited strings, not substrings
- Byte patterns (aka Hexadecimal strings) as {4D 5A 90 00}
    * Accepts “?” and “??” wildcards { E2 34 ?? C8 A? FB }
    * “Jumps” to denote a number of wildcards { E2 34 [3-4] FB }
    * OR Fragements { E2 34 (23 C8 | 24 C8 25) FB }
- Conditions can include boolean operators (and, or, not), relational (>=, <=, <, >, ==, !=), arithmetic (+,-,*,\), and bitwise (&, |, <<, >>, ~)
    * ($a or $b)
    * #a == 6 and #b > 10
    * $a at 100 and $b at 200 (at virtual address)

## Lab: Yara
**Some Rules of Thumb for Creating Yara Rules**
- Analyze sample groups to write yara rules.
- Use tools to help with analysis (HIEW and/or FileInsight)
- You’re looking for unusual commonalities across all samples in the group
- Pay attention to string types (ascii vs wide)
- Good generic rules have fewer strings and conditions

**Example Template Provided by Craig Schmugar**

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Template.JPG">

### Sample Group 1
We were given a series of sample files (Sample Group 1) to analyze with FileInsight and create a Yara rule that would match all the files in the folder Sytro but none of the file in C:\windows\system32

**FileInsight**

**The rule I came up with after string analysis**

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Myrule.JPG">

**Matched 6 of the 7 files in Sytro file**

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/YaraMatches.JPG">

After watching the next presentation and looking at the rule Mr. Schmugar created I noticed I had the string Down which he didnt and I missed the string AikaQ. Once I made those changes to the rule I was able to match all 7 files.

### Sample Group 2
The next group of files are HTML pages under folder CVE-2008-2551 and since I was not able to find anything in common among the files I did a google search for the name of the folder and found the following: 
> The DownloaderActiveX Control (DownloaderActiveX.ocx) in Icona SpA C6 Messenger 1.0.0.1 allows remote attackers to force the download and execution of arbitrary files via a URL in the propDownloadUrl parameter with the propPostDownloadAction parameter set to "run." <sup>1<sup>

After that hint I did a search for the word ActiveX in all files and copy pasted them in Notepad for further analysis. I looked for obvious strings like "download" ".exe" and found the commonalities: 
- 2951ffe67c61 which is part of the CLASSID on all files
- propPostdownloadAction which was followed by "run" in 5 out of six files. 
- Some executable files 
    - http://1.82.184.243:3542/xzz.exe
    - http://artisanballoonz.com/system/system.exe
    - http://hofintech.eu/chat.exe
    - http://www.japan.edu.ms/wg.exe
- DownloaderActiveX

With this in mind I created the following rule and got the following results.

### Sample Group 3
The folder domai for the third sample group contained 22 files. For me to manually analyze all files to find string in common seemed like an impossible task. I remebered from previous lectures that there was a Generate Rules command on the Yara editor. As I was trying to to use this tool I figured that I had no idea what to use on the first column of False Positives and with out entering anything on the column the list of strings was quite long. 

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Nofalse+.JPG">

Since in previous labs we were scanning the C:\Windows\System32 folder I decided to add all files from that folder to the false positive column. After some trial and error as I was getting "this file is in use" errors i was able to enter enough files in the false positive column to get only 3 strings for the yara rule. 

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Allfalse+.JPG">

I found the Generate Rule tool very handy as there is no way I would of been able to find the strings in common on 22 files on my own. 
The rule that was generated was able to catch all 22 files. 

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/SG3Matches.JPG">

I later found out from Lesson 2 lectures that this is not neccessarily best practice as I do not know what the string means and/or if it is being used by clean files. I copied the rule shown in the slides but it only matched 17 files.

**Conclusions**
- Signature creation and malware analysis go hand in hand. You have to do some research into the use of strings so you are not blocking legitimate clean files but also make sure you are trying to get ahead of the bad guys by anticipating their moves. 
- As we saw in the third example signature creation can be tedious which is why most of this job is automated. Automated signatures account for 99% of content, but the best signatures are still created by humans. 

### Anti-malware Automation
**Advantages**
- Scale: Humans can not keep up 
- Consistency
- Performance less of a concern (paranoid heuristics)

**Disadvantages**
- Out of context: this program sends mail this, that program sends mail, this one is bad that one is good. Where do you draw the line?
- Prone to evasion
- Potentially prone to probing and DoS attacks

#### Cuckoo
>You can throw any suspicious file at it and in a matter of minutes Cuckoo will provide a detailed report outlining the behavior of the file when executed inside a realistic but isolated environment.<sup>2</sup>

- Traces of win32 API calls performed by all processes spawned by the malware.
- Files being created, deleted and downloaded by the malware during its execution.
- Memory dumps of the malware processes.
- Network traffic trace in PCAP format.
- Screenshots of Windows desktop taken during the execution of the malware.
- Full memory dumps of the machines.

**Files handled by Cuckoo**
- Generic Windows executables (EXE, DLL, CPL)
- PDF documents
- Microsoft Office documents
- URLs and HTML files
- Scripts (PHP, VB)
- ZIP files
- Java JAR
- Almost anything else

## Lab: Cuckoo
The instructions followed for this lab where: 
- Copy malware\Malware Basics\Class1\Lab2\Replication\Sample1\0012… to \desktop\bad  (no extension)
- Open File Explorer to tools\FakeNet.exe but dont run it yet. 
- Run CMD and Type: CD C:\ANALYZER
- Type: ANALYZER.PY
- Close the error windows about CMD has stopped working
- Run FakeNet.exe
- See results in C:\CUCKOO\LOGS\

For clarity I am giving the files in Desktop\malware\MalwareDefense\Class2 the follwing names: 
**(068D5...)Sample1: Malicious**
Almost immediately opened an error window stating Windows Explorer has stopped working. Dont know if this is part of the malware or just a curios side effect of having file explorer open at the time. 
Creates the following files:
- C:\Windows\System32\wm.ime 
- C:\Windows\Globalization\Sorting\sortdefualt.nls
- Creates a few registry keys having to do with Keyboard Layouts
- C:\Windows\System32\kbdus.dll
- C:\de1a94334c.bat
Note: File deletes itself 

**(00670...)Sample2: Malicious**
When trying to open the log file we get I/O error 32. At first I thought this was a fluke and restored my VM and tried again but got the same result. From cuckoo/files though i was able to tell the files that were created. 
- USER.dll.mui
- Dx.bat
- scrrun.dll
- R000000000013.clb
- text.txt
Can't delete file after using analyzer.py and getting the following error. 
<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/ErrorCHN.JPG">

**(4844FD...)Sample3: OK** 
Seems to run LADS which is a program that lists files with alternate data streams. 

**(A1874...)Sample4: Malicious**
Creates the following files:
- ntshruis2.dll
- Deleteme.bat
- qinput.png
Note: File deletes itself 

### Putting It All Together
- Malware Analysis Aims To:
    + Discover if a threat is present
    + Isolate, Classify, and Remediate the malicious code
    + Defend against future attacks
    + Describe the attack
