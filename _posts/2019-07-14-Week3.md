### YARA (Pattern matching swiss knife for malware researchers)
- Strings expressed as “mystring”, can be followed by
    * nocase – case insensitive
    * wide – strip zeroes in unicode strings
    * wide ascii – searches both wide and ascii strings
    * fullword – only considers full delimited strings, not substrings
- Byte patterns (aka Hexadecimal strings) as {4D 5A 90 00}
    * Accepts “?” and “??” wildcards { E2 34 ?? C8 A? FB }
    * “Jumps” to denote a number of wildcards { E2 34 [3-4] FB }
    * OR Fragements { E2 34 (23 C8 | 24 C8 25) FB }
- Conditions can include boolean operators (and, or, not), relational (>=, <=, <, >, ==, !=), arithmetic (+,-,*,\), and bitwise (&, |, <<, >>, ~)
    * ($a or $b)
    * #a == 6 and #b > 10
    * $a at 100 and $b at 200 (at virtual address)

## Lab: Yara
**Some Rules of Thumb for Creating Yara Rules**
- Analyze sample groups to write yara rules.
- Use tools to help with analysis (HIEW and/or FileInsight)
- You’re looking for unusual commonalities across all samples in the group
- Pay attention to string types (ascii vs wide)
- Good generic rules have fewer strings and conditions

**Example Template Provided by Craig Schmugar**

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Template.JPG">

### Sample Group 1
We were given a series of sample files (Sample Group 1) to analyze with FileInsight and create a Yara rule that would match all the files in the folder Sytro but none of the file in C:\windows\system32

**FileInsight** 

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Insight.JPG">

**The rule I came up with after string analysis**

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Myrule.JPG">

**Matched 6 of the 7 files in Sytro file**

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/YaraMatches.JPG">

After watching the next presentation and looking at the rule Mr. Schmugar created I noticed I had the string Down which he didnt and I missed the string AikaQ. Once I made those changes to the rule I was able to match all 7 files. 

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/7Matches.JPG">

### Sample Group 2
The next group of files are HTML pages under folder CVE-2008-2551 and since I was not able to find anything in common among the files I did a google search for the name of the folder and found the following: 
> The DownloaderActiveX Control (DownloaderActiveX.ocx) in Icona SpA C6 Messenger 1.0.0.1 allows remote attackers to force the download and execution of arbitrary files via a URL in the propDownloadUrl parameter with the propPostDownloadAction parameter set to "run." <sup>1<sup>

After that hint I did a search for the word ActiveX in all files and copy pasted them in Notepad for further analysis. I looked for obvious strings like "download" ".exe" and found the commonalities: 
- 2951ffe67c61 which is part of the CLASSID on all files
- propPostdownloadAction which was followed by "run" in 5 out of six files. 
- Some executable files 
    - http://1.82.184.243:3542/xzz.exe
    - http://artisanballoonz.com/system/system.exe
    - http://hofintech.eu/chat.exe
    - http://www.japan.edu.ms/wg.exe
- DownloaderActiveX

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/html.JPG">

With this in mind I created the following rule and got the following results.

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/SG2Matches.JPG">

### Sample Group 3
The folder domai for the third sample group contained 22 files. For me to manually analyze all files to find string in common seemed like an impossible task. I remebered from previous lectures that there was a Generate Rules command on the Yara editor. As I was trying to to use this tool I figured that I had no idea what to use on the first column of False Positives and with out entering anything on the column the list of strings was quite long. 

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Nofalse+.JPG">

Since in previous labs we were scanning the C:\Windows\System32 folder I decided to add all files from that folder to the false positive column. After some trial and error as I was getting "this file is in use" errors i was able to enter enough files in the false positive column to get only 3 strings for the yara rule. 

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Allfalse+.JPG">

I found the Generate Rule tool very handy as there is no way I would of been able to find the strings in common on 22 files on my own. 
The rule that was generated was able to catch all 22 files. 

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/SG3Matches.JPG">

I later found out from Lesson 2 lectures that this is not neccessarily best practice as I do not know what the string means and/or if it is being used by clean files. I copied the rule shown in the slides but it only matched 17 files. 

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/LectureCode.JPG">

**Conclusions**
- Signature creation and malware analysis go hand in hand. You have to do some research into the use of strings so you are not blocking legitimate clean files but also make sure you are trying to get ahead of the bad guys by anticipating their moves. 
- As we saw in the third example signature creation can be tedious which is why most of this job is automated. Automated signatures account for 99% of content, but the best signatures are still created by humans. 

### Anti-malware Automation
**Advantages**
- Scale: Humans can not keep up 
- Consistency
- Performance less of a concern (paranoid heuristics)

**Disadvantages**
- Out of context: this program sends mail this, that program sends mail, this one is bad that one is good. Where do you draw the line?
- Prone to evasion
- Potentially prone to probing and DoS attacks

#### Cuckoo
>You can throw any suspicious file at it and in a matter of minutes Cuckoo will provide a detailed report outlining the behavior of the file when executed inside a realistic but isolated environment.<sup>2</sup>

- Traces of win32 API calls performed by all processes spawned by the malware.
- Files being created, deleted and downloaded by the malware during its execution.
- Memory dumps of the malware processes.
- Network traffic trace in PCAP format.
- Screenshots of Windows desktop taken during the execution of the malware.
- Full memory dumps of the machines.

**Files handled by Cuckoo**
- Generic Windows executables (EXE, DLL, CPL)
- PDF documents
- Microsoft Office documents
- URLs and HTML files
- Scripts (PHP, VB)
- ZIP files
- Java JAR
- Almost anything else

## Lab: Cuckoo
The instructions followed for this lab where: 
- Copy malware\Malware Basics\Class1\Lab2\Replication\Sample1\0012… to \desktop\bad  (no extension)
- Open File Explorer to tools\FakeNet.exe but dont run it yet. 
- Run CMD and Type: CD C:\ANALYZER
- Type: ANALYZER.PY
- Close the error windows about CMD has stopped working
- Run FakeNet.exe
- See results in C:\CUCKOO\LOGS\

For clarity I am giving the files in Desktop\malware\MalwareDefense\Class2 the follwing names: 

**(068D5...)Sample1: Malicious**

Almost immediately opened an error window stating Windows Explorer has stopped working. Dont know if this is part of the malware or just a curios side effect of having file explorer open at the time. 
Creates the following files:
- C:\Windows\System32\wm.ime 
- C:\Windows\Globalization\Sorting\sortdefualt.nls
- Creates a few registry keys having to do with Keyboard Layouts
- C:\Windows\System32\kbdus.dll
- C:\de1a94334c.bat
Note: File deletes itself 

**(00670...)Sample2: Malicious**

When trying to open the log file we get I/O error 32. At first I thought this was a fluke and restored my VM and tried again but got the same result. From cuckoo/files though I was able to tell the files that were created. 
- USER.dll.mui
- Dx.bat
- scrrun.dll
- R000000000013.clb
- text.txt
Can't delete file after using analyzer.py and getting the following error. 
<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/ErrorCHN.JPG">

**(4844FD...)Sample3: OK** 

Seems to run LADS which is a program that lists files with alternate data streams. 

**(A1874...)Sample4: Malicious**

Creates the following files and saves then in the Appdata\Local\Temp fodler:
- ntshruis2.dll : 
>The genuine ntshrui.dll file is a software component of Microsoft Windows Operating System by Microsoft.
The DLL file associated with sharing in Windows, this file allows folders in the operating system to be shared across a network. When implemented, a folder on a given machine can appear as a local folder would on another computer on the network. This allows for saving files, copying, transferring, etc. as easy as manipulating files locally. 
**Important:** Some malware disguises itself as ntshrui.dll, particularly when not located in the C:\Windows\System32 folder. <sup>3</sup>
- Deleteme.bat : deletes de malware file after it has installed files in the temp folder
- qinput.png: Converted the text from the png using OCR so I could do a google translate. Seems to be a asking for login and password stating the network is unstable.

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Translate.JPG">

**Note:** File deletes itself using the script in the Deleteme.bat file

Using Process Monitor while running the analyzer.py on this file I found a suspicious file called conhost.exe. After a simple google search my suspicions where confirmed. This is a known trojan used for cryptocurrency miner malware. It "has been reported to use the CPU and GPU of the victim’s computer in order to mine for the cryptocurrency Monero. The malware has been reported to run an executable that imitates the legitimate Console Windows Host process." <sup>4</sup> 
<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/conhost.JPG">
Conhost uses an algorithm  to calculate hashes  used to sum up blocks on the block chain of Monero and then mine cryptocurrency tokens by using the victims CPU to do the calculations on the hashes. Mentioned in the article is the fact that the malicious activity begins by dropping the conhost process in the AppData\Roaming\Microsfot folder. This behaviour was confirmed by Process Monitor. 
<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Appdata.JPG">

Also added is a registry entry with the intention of running uninterrupted and automatically when OS is started. This is done from what I can tell from the executable downloaded into the temp files called prints.exe which is a common enough name for a file that may not raise any flags. 
<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Prints.JPG">

In addition to using your CPU this malware may also be using a keylogger, taking screenshots of the infected computer, stealing files from the infected computer, stealing passwords and login identifications.  I believe most of this is being done with the help of the ntshruis2.dll file. 

**Yara Rule Creation**
I honestly got lucky when creating the Yara Rule. First I opened the yara Editor and right clicked on the file and selected Inspect. 
In the Inspector area I selected the Strings tab and went through it until something popped out to me. @@YAKXZB was one of those strings and after doing a google search the first results showed a malware analysis page from a website called Totalhash. This website showed exactly the files created and the full path for each, which matched exactly what I had previously found. 

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Totalhash.JPG"><sup>5</sup>

Not surprisingly when I use this string "YAKXZB" in the Yara Rule the correct file is matched.

**Remove Conhost.exe Miner Malware**
- Restart your PC in Safe Mode 
- Go to the Registry and delete any values created by malware. Common Registries affected by this malware are:  
    * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
    * HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
    * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
    * HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce   
<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Registry.JPG">
- Delete all files created by conhost.exe in the temp file 
- It is highly recommended to use a malware detection and removal tool to search for conhost.exe and permanently delete all files associated with it.
