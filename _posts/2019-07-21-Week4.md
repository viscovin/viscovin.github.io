# Software Vulnerabilities and Exploits
### Hacking
- Controlling the program in a way that was not originally intended. 
- Thinking outside of the box trying to understand what the developer didnt think about and using it to your advantage. 
- Taking advantage of a misconfiguration or poor programming practice.
- Finding "bugs" which alter the behavior of the program.
All of the above with the ultimate goal of taking control/ gain access of the system.

**Bug Bounty Programs:** individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to exploits and vulnerabilities. <sup>1</sup>
