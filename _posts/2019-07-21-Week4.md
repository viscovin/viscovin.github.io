# Software Vulnerabilities and Exploits
### Hacking
- Controlling the program in a way that was not originally intended. 
- Thinking outside of the box trying to understand what the developer didnt think about and using it to your advantage. 
- Taking advantage of a misconfiguration or poor programming practice.
- Finding "bugs" which alter the behavior of the program.

All of the above with the ultimate goal of taking control/ gain access of the system.

**Bug Bounty Programs:** individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to exploits and vulnerabilities. <sup>1</sup>

Shift in attacks in the last few years...
5-8 years ago (since lecture was recorded) attacks would target DMZ or border systems (company's website, email server). 
Nowadays atttackers are shifting their focus to target the user with phishing and social engineering. 

**WinDBG:** Freezes the program (to a certain extent) so it allows you to interact and inspect the various states of a particular program at a particular point in its execution.

**Some Useful Commands:**
- lm: List Modules
- lmf m <*string*> : List all modules that match a specific string
- bp: set a breakpoint 
- bl: breakpoint list
- g: go
- dd <*string*>: display dword of memory 
- db <*string*>: view the bytes
- u <*string*>: unassemble
- formats <*number*>: translates number into hex, decimal, octal, binary, chars, time, float, double. 
- dv: display local variables
- da: displays ASCII characters
- du: displays Unicode characters
- t: executes a single instruction or source line
- p: executes a single instruction  or source line
- pt: executes the program until a return instruction is reached
- q: quit

##Lab: WinDBG
Open WindDbg
Open FSExploitme 
On WinDbg Click on File>Attach to a Process  and select the second iexplorer from the list of process  
Set a break point at address 54431df0
On explorer window click on link "click here"
