# Software Vulnerabilities and Exploits
### Hacking
- Controlling the program in a way that was not originally intended. 
- Thinking outside of the box trying to understand what the developer didnt think about and using it to your advantage. 
- Taking advantage of a misconfiguration or poor programming practice.
- Finding "bugs" which alter the behavior of the program.

All of the above with the ultimate goal of taking control/ gain access of the system.

**Bug Bounty Programs:** individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to exploits and vulnerabilities. <sub>1</sub>

Shift in attacks in the last few years...
5-8 years ago (since lecture was recorded) attacks would target DMZ or border systems (company's website, email server). 
Nowadays atttackers are shifting their focus to target the user with phishing and social engineering. 

**WinDBG:** Freezes the program (to a certain extent) so it allows you to interact and inspect the various states of a particular program at a particular point in its execution.

**Some Useful Commands:** <sub>2</sub>
- lm: List Modules
- lmf m <*string*> : List all modules that match a specific string
- bp: set a breakpoint 
- bl: breakpoint list
- g: go
- dd <*string*>: display dword of memory 
- db <*string*>: view the bytes
- u <*string*>: unassemble
- .formats <*number*>: translates number into hex, decimal, octal, binary, chars, time, float, double. 
- dv: display local variables
- da: displays ASCII characters
- du: displays Unicode characters
- t: executes a single instruction or source line
- p: executes a single instruction  or source line
- pt: executes the program until a return instruction is reached
- q: quit
- !teb: displays a formatted view of the information in the thread environment block (TEB) 
- !peb: displays a formatted view of the information in the process environment block (PEB).
- !address: displays information about the memory that the target process or target computer uses.

## Lab: WinDBG

- Open WindDbg
- Open FSExploitme 
- On WinDbg Click on File>Attach to a Process  and select the second iexplorer from the list of process  
- Set a break point at address 54431df0
- On explorer window click on link "click here"

### Flaw Classes and Vulnerabilities
- Configuration: Weak password
- Logic: Authorization issues
- Storage: Inadequate encryption
- Input Validiaton: Memory corruption and injection

#### Memory Corruption 
Accessing (reading/writting) memory (usually stack or heap) in an invalid way (originally unintended) which results in an undefined behavior. (What we are looking to control)

**Categories**
- Lifetime Control
- Uninitialized Memory
- Array index calculations
- Buffer length calculations

**Some Definitions**
- **Explotation:** taking advantage of a vulnerability.
- **Exploit:** input, data, code provided to program that is going to cause some conditon
- **Vulnerability Trigger:** invokes the software bug to obtain control of the program
- **Payload:** action to be performed when control is obtained (shell code usually assembly code) 

**The Metasploit Project** is a computer security project that provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing and IDS signature development. It is owned by Boston, Massachusetts-based security company Rapid7.

>*History:* Metasploit was created by H. D. Moore in 2003 as a portable network tool using Perl. By 2007, the Metasploit Framework had been completely rewritten in Ruby.[4] On October 21, 2009, the Metasploit Project announced that it had been acquired by Rapid7, a security company that provides unified vulnerability management solutions.<sub>3</sub>

### Linear Stack Overflow 
**1. Crash Triage**
*- What do we control?*
    – What Registers contain attacker-controlled data?
    – What Registers point to attacker-controlled data?
    – Is attacker controlled data on the Stack or the Heap?
    – Do we control critical data such as stack frames?
*- Where are we in the execution of the program?* 
    – Where is the vulnerability?
    – Was the crash caused by an exploit mitigation?
**2. Determine the return address offset**
*- How many bytes between our buffer and the return address on the stack?*
    - Figure out the offset to EIP overwrite 
**3. Position our shellcode**
*- Construct a string constructed with a filler junk data up until the return address, overwrite the return address with something special,add shellcode to the end of it. 
**4. Find the address of our shellcode**
*- Trampoline Technique: Look for ffe4 anywhere in memory and replace the return address with that JMP ESP instruction

## Lab: Exploit!
1. Modify L2Exercise1() to pass msfPatternString. Trigger the vulnerability, at what offset is EIP overwritten?
**1028**

2. Modify L2Exercise1() to fill the stack with 41 and overwrite eip with 42424242

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Lab2_Q2.JPG">

3. What is the address  of a jmp esp (ff e4) instruction within the memory space allocated to FSExploitMe?
**54432437**

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/Lab2_Q3.JPG">

**4. Modify L2Exercise1() replace 42424242 with the address of jmp esp add in the shellcode.**

5. How does the instruction at  54432159 change our exploit?
**4 bytes are removed off the stack we need to give it 4 bytes to account for that.**

6. Structure the filler, jmp esp, and shellcode in  L2Exercise1(). Click to launch the calculator.
