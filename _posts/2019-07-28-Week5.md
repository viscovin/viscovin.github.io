# Windows Internals
## Memory Manipulation 
### Rootkits 
- Malware that actively conceals its existence and actions from users and system processes.
- Approximately 10% of current malware use rootkit
- Rootkits are most prevalent in 32 bit Windows
- Handful of families so far for 64 bit
- Rootkits are one of the best way to learn about kernel security challenges.

**Challenges once malicious code enters kernel**
- Harder for rootkits to enter 64 bit kernel
- Rootkits can infiltrate 64 bit OS Kernel by

  a) Bypassing driver signing check (e.g. using testsigning mode)
  
  b) Modifying the windows boot path (MBR etc) – Secure boot prevents this.
  
  c) Kernel exploits in Windows kernel  or third party drivers.
  
  d) Stealing valid digisigs (Similar to Stuxnet)

**Kernal Memory**
- Is a flat memory model with no security separation. 
- Any kernel driver can access any part of memory. 
- Composed of windows kernel (ntoskrnl.exe) as well as driver code. 
- Many important structures that are prime targets for stealth. SSDT, IRP, IDT etc. 
- Windbg commands: .process command, lm, !devobj, !drvobj, !devstack, !irp etc. Virtual to physical memory etc.

## Lab: Rootkit Agony Analysis
**Instructions** 
- Extract and copy file from C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\malware\WindowsInternals\Agony.zip  to \Desktop\bad (no extension)
- Run FakeNet
- Run Cuckoo

Files found in Cuckoo where:
- bad.bin
- tzres.dll.bin
- tzres.dll.mui.bin
- sortdefault.nls.bin

After running Tuluka and dir \*.sys on CMD we see hidden file created "wininit.sys"

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/agony2.JPG">

We then opened livekd and unassemble the code in addresses shown in the Tuluka app
u 82c70ebf for the actual NtEnumerateValueKey 
u 97143480 for what is there now after running "bad"

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viscovin/viscovin.github.io/master/images/agony3.jpg">

Using livekd we use command **dps n!KiServiceTable L191** shows the list of the systems API's with three columns 
- Address Pointer
- Address of Code 
- Name of API

Scrolling through this list we can find anomalies

### Threads
Thread is the smallest ‘unit’ of execution that can execute code.

**Important concepts of a thread**
- Thread Context: stores all the related register values of the thread. During execution register values are stored in CPU , else they are in Memory.  KD> DT _CONTEXT
- Thread Stack: Each Thread has its own stack.   
   * User mode stack. 
       - Used for thread’s function calls and local variables. 
   * Kernel Stack. 
      - Used when control is transferred from user to kernel. 
      - Data is copied for security.
- Thread Environment Block (TEB): TEB contains threat specific information like Exception handling and TLS. KD> DT _TEB
- Thread Scheduling
- Thread – Process relationship

**Thread Object defines a thread**
- Kernel Object are data structure defined by OS to describe various OS constructs, thread being one such construct.
- TEB, ThreatStack, Context, Priority, State etc are all defined within this struct.

**NOTE:** Windbg command to see thread object : KD> dt_KTHREAD

### Process Memory 
- Processes are implemented as objects
- An executable process may contain one or more threads.
- Process includes an object table that has handles to other objects known to this process. 
- A process needs at least one thread to execute.

## Lab: Process Hacker
Launch Process Hacker from Tools Folder 
Launch Notepad application and on the Process Hacker application double click on it to get pop up with more info.

After getting familiar with Process Hacker we are to copy the files from zbot.zip on to the Desktop and run the file "maleware.exe"
Open a new instance of notepad and go through its properties to find anythign that wasnt there before. 

It is not always the case but we see processes with no name with RWX permissions. Everything else with execution permissions has a name.

### Hooking Basics

**Kernel Debugging (more powerful than merely using liveKD)**
Finding memory patterns and following the pointers in memory, along with some good notes taking capabilities. 
- It is like any other program debugging you do in your HLL code except you will be looking at assembly code.
- It’s a cool way to be able to trace each and every instruction of OS from a remote machine.
- Vast amount of code – so we need Smart debugging , and context aware debugging.

**Useful Commands**
- !process 0 0 -> Lists  all the running processes (Returns EPROCESS Object)
- !process -1 0 -> Returns current process.
- .process /i  <eprocess> -> Change the context to process described by <eprocess>
- Lmu -> Lists all the user mode modules within a process.

## Lab: Kernel Debugging
- On vSphere make sure both win-debugee and win-debugger machines are turned on. Log in to win-debugger and launch WinDbg(x86) from the Tools folder. 
- Click on File/Kernel Debug you will see a message "Waiting to reconnect" 
- Click on Debug/Break and you will see a message "You are seeing this message because you  pressed either CTRL-C...."
- You are now able to enter commands in WinDbg 
- Command: u NtEnumerateValueKey
- Command: bp 82e98a0f

*Note:* Even though I entered a breakpoint for NtEnumerateValueKey debugee kept on running so I decided to make break point for  NtQueryDirectoryFile and for NtQuerySystemInformation.
